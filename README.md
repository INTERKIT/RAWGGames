## Tech Stack
Template uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
* [Koin] - A pragmatic lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin developers.
* [Stetho] - Stetho is a sophisticated debug bridge for Android applications.
* [Retrofit2] - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
* [Paging] - The Paging Library helps you load and display small chunks of data at a time. Loading partial data on demand reduces usage of network bandwidth and system resources.
* [RxJava/RxAndroid] - RxJava bindings for Android
* [Room] - persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
